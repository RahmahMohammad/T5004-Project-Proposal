This will help in planing the marketing strategy and in the development decision process. 

## Design
This project originates from Data Science Bootcamps for SDAIA Academy. 
The data is provided by 
, and presents .
Classifying --------  via machine learning models would enable the ------- to ---------

## Data
The dataset contains #### ----- with ## features for each, ## of which are categorical.


## Algorithms
## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
- Tableau for interactive visualizations
## Communication

#### Question/need:
* **What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**  
To determine the customer attributes and predict the change of the sales if we add / remove / change on the features of the prodact or service.
